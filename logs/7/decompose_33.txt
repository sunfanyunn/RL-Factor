The game designer is building a single-player game in Pygame by modeling this game as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
There are three types of functions/modules in this game: input event handling, state transition, and UI rendering. 
- input event handling: functions that detect user input and update the state variables accordingly.
- state transition: functions that update the state variables according to the game logic.
- UI rendering: functions that render the state variables as UI components on the screen.

Given a specific feature requested by the game designer, your task is to decide how to implement this feature by decomposing it into the three types of functions/modules mentioned above.

The game already has the following implementation:
```python
import pygame
import sys
import random


class StateManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # height of the gameplay screen
        self.SCREEN_HEIGHT = int(600)
        
        # width of the gameplay screen
        self.SCREEN_WIDTH = int(800)
        
        # fps of the gameplay screen
        self.FPS = int(60)
        
        # The score of the player, representing the number of pipes successfully passed
        self.score = int(0)
        
        # The color of the score text in RGB format, ensuring visibility over the background
        self.score_text_color = tuple(tuple((0, 0, 0)))
        
        # The font size of the score text
        self.score_font_size = int(30)
        
        # The x-coordinate for where to display the score on the screen
        self.score_position_x = int(10)
        
        # The y-coordinate for where to display the score on the screen
        self.score_position_y = int(50)

Please provide the answer in the following format within a JSON object:
```json
{
    "input_logic": {
        "description": "the detailed description of what this function should achieve.",
        "function_name": "the name of the function to be added",
    },
    "state_transition": {
        "description": "the detailed description of what this function should achieve",
        "function_name": "the name of the function to be added",
    },
    "ui_rendering": {
        "description": "the detailed description of what this function should achieve",
        "function_name": "the name of the function to be added",
    },
   
}
```

The game designer's request is: Show the current score in the top-left corner of the screen during gameplay..

Here are the dos and don'ts for this request:
- Only give output that pertains to the particular request from the game designer. Do not add things that are not requested. For example, if the game designer asks to "introduce an obstacle", do not add additional logics such as "allow the human player to control the obstacle with arrow keys".
- Be detailed and specific about what the function should achieve. For example, do not give instructions such as "description": "This function should handle input events relevant to the game.".
- The resulting JSON should have three keys: "input_logic", "state_transition", and "ui_rendering". Each key should have two keys: "description" and "function_name". The "description" key should have a string value that describes what the function should achieve. The "function_name" key should have a string value that is the name of the function to be added. If the function already exists, this new function will be used in place of the old one.
- If any particular type of functions is not needed, please leave it as an empty string. It is okay to have empty strings if the function has already been implemented.
- The state variables are already updated according to the game designer's request. You should not include steps that update the state variables.
