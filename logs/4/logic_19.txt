The game designer is building a single-player game in Pygame by modeling this game as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Your task is to define and code new state transition functions according to the feature requested by the game designer.
The game has the following implementation already:
```python
import pygame
import sys
import random


class StateManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # height of the gameplay screen
        self.SCREEN_HEIGHT = int(600)
        
        # width of the gameplay screen
        self.SCREEN_WIDTH = int(800)
        
        # fps of the gameplay screen
        self.FPS = int(60)
        
        # The current y-coordinate of the bird character
        self.bird_y_position = int(300)
        
        # The fixed x-coordinate of the bird character
        self.bird_x_position = int(100)
        
        # Height of the bird character
        self.bird_height = int(25)
        
        # Width of the bird character
        self.bird_width = int(25)
        
        # List of positions of pipe pairs, where each pair is a dictionary with x, upper_y, and lower_y
        self.pipes_list = list([{'x': 800, 'upper_y': 0, 'lower_y': 350}])
        
        # Width of each pipe
        self.pipe_width = int(50)
        
        # Height of the upper part of a pipe pair, with a default that ensures a gap
        self.pipe_upper_height = int(200)
        
        # Velocity at which the pipes move left across the screen
        self.pipe_velocity = int(5)
        
        # Vertical space between the upper and lower pipes
        self.pipe_gap = int(150)
        
        # The color of the bird character in RGB format
        self.bird_color = tuple(tuple((255, 204, 0)))
        
        # The color of the pipes in RGB format, which should not be white
        self.pipe_color = tuple(tuple((0, 255, 0)))
        


# the new function will be here



def main():
    state_manager = StateManager()
    running = True
    while running:
        event = pygame.event.poll()
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
        # {function_description}
        {function_name}(state_manager)
    pygame.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pygame.init()
    main()
```

Please implement the following request from the game designer and return your answer in the following format:
```json
{
    "function_name": "check_for_collisions",
    "function_description": "This function checks if there is any collision between the bird and the pipes or the bottom of the game window. For each pipe in the state manager's pipes_list, it assesses whether the bird's rectangle intersects with either the upper or lower pipe. It also checks if the bird has collided with the bottom of the game window. If a collision is detected, the game should end by setting a state variable that indicates the game is over.",
    "function_implementation": "the pygame implementation of the function, including the first line of the function definition",
}
```

Here are the dos and don'ts for this request:
- Only implement things that pertain to updating the state variables. Other aspects of the game like input event handling and UI components will be handled separately.
- Minimize the number of functions added while meeting the game designer's requirements.
- Include only the essential details requested by the game designer. Do not add things that are not requested.
- These state transition functions will be called in every iteration of the main game loop. If you want to add a conditional logic to the function, please implement it in the function itself.
- Note that the new function will be added to the end of the list of state transition functions.
