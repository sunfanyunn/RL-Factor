The game designer is building a single-player game in Pygame by modeling this game as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Your task is to detect key/mouse input and update the state variables accordingly according to a feature requested by the game designer.
The game has the following implementation already:
```python
import pygame
import sys
import random


class StateManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # height of the gameplay screen
        self.SCREEN_HEIGHT = int(600)
        
        # width of the gameplay screen
        self.SCREEN_WIDTH = int(800)
        
        # fps of the gameplay screen
        self.FPS = int(60)
        
        # The current y-coordinate of the bird character
        self.bird_y_position = int(300)
        
        # The fixed x-coordinate of the bird character
        self.bird_x_position = int(100)
        
        # Height of the bird character
        self.bird_height = int(25)
        
        # Width of the bird character
        self.bird_width = int(25)
        
        # The color of the bird character in RGB format
        self.bird_color = tuple(tuple((255, 204, 0)))
        
        # The velocity at which the bird moves up or down
        self.bird_velocity = int(5)
        
        # The acceleration due to gravity affecting the bird
        self.gravity = float(0.2)
        
        # The current vertical velocity of the bird considering gravity
        self.bird_vertical_velocity = float(0.0)
        
        # The value by which the bird's vertical velocity increases when the player inputs a flap
        self.flap_power = float(-5.0)
        
        # The terminal velocity of the bird (the maximum speed at which the bird can fall)
        self.terminal_velocity = float(10.0)
        


# the new logic function will be here


def main():
    state_manager = StateManager()
    running = True
    while running:
        event = pygame.event.poll()
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
        # {function_description}
        {function_name}(state_manager, event)
    pygame.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pygame.init()
    main()
```

Please implement the following request from the game designer and return your answer in the following format:
```json
{
    "function_name": "handle_bird_flap",
    "function_description": "Modify the bird's vertical velocity by a certain amount upwards when the user inputs a flap (up arrow key), counteracting gravity. When the up arrow is pressed, increase bird's vertical velocity by the flap power value.",
    "function_implementation": "the pygame implementation of the function, including the first line of the function definition",
}
```

Here are the dos and don'ts for this request:
- Note that the implementation of the function shuold only have two arguments (i.e. state_manager and event).
- The function implementation should involve checking user input with event (i.e. event.type and event.key).
- Minimize the number of functions added while meeting the game designer's requirements. However, make sure to always give the full implementation of the function.
- Include only the essential details requested by the game designer. Do not add things that are not requested.
