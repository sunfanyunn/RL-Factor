The game designer is building a single-player game in Pygame by modeling this game as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
Your task is to identify and compile a list of relevant state variables to implement a specific feature requested by the game designer.
The game already has the following state space implementation:
```python
import pygame
import sys
import random


class StateManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # height of the gameplay screen
        self.SCREEN_HEIGHT = int(600)
        
        # width of the gameplay screen
        self.SCREEN_WIDTH = int(800)
        
        # fps of the gameplay screen
        self.FPS = int(60)
        
        # The current y-coordinate of the bird character
        self.bird_y_position = int(300)
        
        # The fixed x-coordinate of the bird character
        self.bird_x_position = int(100)
        
        # Height of the bird character
        self.bird_height = int(25)
        
        # Width of the bird character
        self.bird_width = int(25)
        
        # The color of the bird character in RGB format
        self.bird_color = tuple(tuple((255, 204, 0)))
        
        # The velocity at which the bird moves up or down
        self.bird_velocity = int(5)
        


    # new variables will be added here:
    # variable_description
    self.{variable_name} = {variable_type}({value})
```

Please provide the state variables in the following format within a JSON object:
```json
{
    "state_variables": [
        {
            "variable_description": "Description of the variable",
            "variable_name": "Name of the variable",
            "variable_type": "Type of the variable, one of {int, float, str, bool, tuple, list}",
            "variable_value": "Value of the variable, e.g. 100, 0.5, 'balloon', tuple((255, 0, 255)), True, [10, 50], [{'x': 100, 'y': 200}]",
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

The game designer's request is: Introduce gravity, causing the bird to continuously fall unless counteracted by player input..
Here are the dos and don'ts for this request:
- Additionally, you may add new state variables if necessary, but prioritize reusing the existing state variables as much as possible. For example, if we have "position_x" and "position_y" of the protagonist character, do not give me another variable "positions" in a list format.
- Please return a single list of state variables that contains both existing variables that you think are relevant and new state variables.
- A software engineer will later implement this request by implementing a function that takes these variables as input, so ensure all the variables needed to implement the request are included.
- It is okay to include variables that don't end up being used in the implementation because redundant state variables will be filtered out later.
- Please provide all rendering variables (e.g., size, color) if there are components to be rendered. Color should never be white since the background is white.
- Don't provide Sprite, Surface, or Rect variables. We will handle these variables later.
- Don't introduce variables using existing variables (e.g., self.bird_size = self.pipe_size/2), all state variables should be independent of each other.
- Always provide a default value even if a state variable should be chosen randomly. The randomness will be implemented later.
- "variable_value" should never to empty like []. Always provide a non-empty default value so the software engineer can infer how the variable can be accessed.
