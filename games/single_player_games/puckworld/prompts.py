iterative_prompts = """Create an agent character, visually represented as a blue circle, positioned on the screen. The agent should be movable in any direction based on user input.
Implement a green dot that moves randomly around the screen, serving as the target for the agent to navigate towards.
Introduce a red puck, a larger entity that slowly follows the agent's movements on the screen.
Allow the player to control the agent's movement using arrow keys or another specified input method.
Detect collisions between the agent and the red puck. If the agent collides with the red puck, end the game and display a "Game Over!" message.
Implement scoring mechanics where the player earns points each time the agent successfully reaches and overlaps with the green dot.
Display the current score in the top-left corner of the screen during gameplay.
Ensure the game has no predefined end, allowing for endless gameplay. 
When the game ends, provide an option for the player to restart the game.
Upon reaching the green dot, relocate it to a new random position, maintaining the challenge for the player."""
